# frontend_credit_card_system
React Js Application
**Technologies** :

Javascript (EcmaScript 6)
React
Ajax Jquery
CSS

**Functionality overview** :

This application allows to perform Create/Read operations.

Users can add new Credit Cards to the System and each credit card has 3 attributes: User Name, Card Number, withdrawal Limit. The User will then be able to view the added credit cards as a list in a table.

The Application allows to insert 16 to 19 digit card numbers and also allows users to write such numbers in full or by writing the digits separated by spaces or dashes. It will be then the App to elaborate and format the card's numbers. All the Card Numbers must work against the Luhn 10 algorithm, otherwise validation errors will be displayed.

The Luhn 10 algorithm has been implemented on both front-end and back-end to provide a more secure application.
React is used to create a single-page dynamic UI.

Ajax JQuery to handle the REST requests from front-end to back-end.
